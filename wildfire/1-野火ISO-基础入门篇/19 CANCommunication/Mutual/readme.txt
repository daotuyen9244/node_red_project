Experimental steps:
1. The experimental code consists of two parts, which are burned to two development boards.
        
  2. The slave is powered on first, then the host is powered on, because the experiment is to send data to the slave.

  3. Connect the serial port to the slave or the host, and you can see the experimental data.
